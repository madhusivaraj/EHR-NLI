## Description
Electronic Health Record (EHR) related problems have proved to be costly for hospitals, stress-inducing for physicians, and life-threatening for patients. To solve this, we developed a Natural Language Interface (NLI) that can assist doctors with navigating the maze of patient data. By simply taking in the doctor's question as input, our system will query the patient health database and find relevant information, and then construct a natural language answer as output. Motivated by the TRanslate-Edit Model for Question-to-SQL generative model, we integrate this to translate the input question to a SQL query using a Seq2Seq-based model and edit the generated query. Our application is a case study of the real-world efficacy of using modern natural language understanding and natural language generation techniques to create an EHR NLI. With an accuracy of 55%, our results have shown that current Natural Language Question to SQL models are not accurate enough to make into a practical NLI.

## Seq2SQL

### Setup
Requires a GPU to run.

Dataset require
- MIMIC-SQL  (public)
- MIMIC III (private due to HIPAA-compliance)

### Run


- ```Training:``` python TREQS/main.py 

- ```Validate:``` python TREQS/main.py --task validate

- ```Test:``` python TREQS/main.py --task test

## Natural Language Generation

For this portion of our project, we used [RosaeNLG](https://rosaenlg.org/rosaenlg/1.14.3/index.html), an open-source (MIT) Natural Language Generation (NLG) library written in JavaScript, based on the Pug template engine. 
RosaeNLG is the first open-source NLG library which is easy to use and complete enough to write real life NLG applications. It can be run both server side (node.js) and client side, in a browser.

### Setup
~~~~
cd /natural-language-generation/
npm install
~~~~

### Run
~~~~
npx rosaenlg-cli -l lang -w <template_filepath>
ex: npx rosaenlg-cli -l en_US -w templates_malesmokers/male_smokers_over45.pug
~~~~

## Patient Browser

Code for Patient Browser taken from: https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/patient-browser

### Setup
